### Features

**1) Diary :** A place where user can write his/her daily experience. Further the user can share his/her diary on the community as sharing one'experience can always make a person feel better. During sharing user can choose to remain anonymous or revail his/her name, thus protecting user's identity.

**2)Music :** As per the research done by numerous organizations, music can be useful in helping depressed people or the people who are feeling down. We are adding this feature so users can listen to the song according to their mood.

**3)Recommendation :** Depressed people generally dont know how what they should do , using this feature we will recommend them some basic things they can do such as meditation which can help them to relax.

**4)Therapist :** Even though there are lots of features available which can help  the users to alleviate their mood, talking to the therapist can always be more fruitful since they can guide you as per your condition.

**5)Community :** Sharing your thoughts on the community can be fruitful as you can get to know other people who are suffering from depression. Hear their experience about how they deal with stress, depression and try to implement it in your life. To prevent spamming of abusive, hateful comment in the community we will use Machine Learning model for the detection of such inappropriate comments. We have also added report feature so user can report a person sending inappropriate content, which can be banned by the admin after reviewing the persons account.
